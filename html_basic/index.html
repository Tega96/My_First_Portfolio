                I am currently learning to programming at alx, and at the same time, teaching others how to code at DYB Africa. 
                This experience in lagos has been quite fulfilling thus far.

            <h3>More about Lagos</h3>
            <p>
                let me tell you of my stay in Lagos. All of it, and all the people in it are beautiful and crazy at the same time. 
                I once heard someone claim that nearly all the men in lagos are mad, but i am yet to confirm that, as i have already seen some.
